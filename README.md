A Sinatra app that retrieves machine-readable information from web pages and generates embed code if it's a known type.

Currently supports:

* YouTube videos (including 'short' format)
* Vimeo videos

Plans to include:

* Flickr
* Instagram
* SoundCloud
* Spotify
* Tomahawk
* Twitter

## Example
A live (experimental) example exists at http://gentle-stream-2944.herokuapp.com/ :

    GET http://gentle-stream-2944.herokuapp.com/?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYElrdil-M

### Returns:

    {
      "type": "youtube",
      "url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYElrdil-M",
      "title": "Save The Arts: An Important Message About the Arts by David Shrigley - YouTube",
      "description": "David Shrigley's brilliant new video as part of Save The Arts, a new campaign by more than 100 leading UK artists urging the government not to cut arts fundi...",
      "id": "1iYElrdil-M",
      "embed_code": "&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/1iYElrdil-M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;"
    }

Also supports JSONP given a callback param.

## Contribute

Adding a new 'type' requires adding a new class that inherits from UrlResource, then adding the class name to the types array in `get.rb` (before `UrlResource`). The `PATTERN` constant is used to match the url. See any class in the `url_resources` directory for an example.
